Do you love music? Do you want to make a difference? You can now make a direct donation to help support the McGill Choral Society-SSMU in its ongoing quest to bring music into the lives of choir members, as well as to the Montreal community.

The costs associated with running a choir of this size and caliber are tremendous. Your support allows us to pay for our expenses — including musicians, soloists, space rentals, concert program printing — giving choir members the opportunity to focus on what’s most important: the music!

 

# How will my donation help?

Although MCS members pay fees and participate in fundraising activities, we rely on the generous support of the choir alumni and friends to provide a portion of our operating budget. Even a small donation can make a large impact.

Here are some ways your tax-deductible gift can make a difference:

- $25 will provide music and scores for one choir member
- $150 will pay for the piano accompanist for one rehearsal
- $300 will cover the cost of a concert musician or soloist
- $450 will pay for roughly one-fourth of the church hall rental

 

# How can I make a donation?

You can either make a donation online or by sending a cheque in the regular mail. All donations greater than $20 are tax-deductible and will receive a tax receipt.
